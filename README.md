## Introduction
Fake news is a growing concern in the digital age. This project utilizes a dataset of news articles and applies machine learning algorithms to classify them. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The main content of the project is encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook, `Fake_News_Classification.ipynb`, which includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation of model performance

## Installation
To run the notebook on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Fake_News_Classification
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `Fake_News_Classification.ipynb` in your browser and run the cells.

## Usage
The notebook is designed to be run sequentially. Each section builds upon the previous one. Follow the instructions within the notebook to:
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models
- Analyze model performance

## Dependencies
The project is developed in Python 3.8 and requires the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
